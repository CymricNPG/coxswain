Coxswain helps you organize your rowing: Connect your Android device to your Waterrower and choose your training program. 

- record your workout while watching Youtube videos or other media (choose an intent to be executed on training start)
- row against previous workouts
- adjust the workout display (long press to choice from distance, duration, strokes, energy, speed, pulse, stroke rate, stroke ratio, time, split, average split, delta distance, delta duration)
- export your workout to TCX (Training Center XML) to import it into your favorite fitness tracking App or service.
- export your workout to Google Fit (experimental)
- read heart rate from your Waterrower, Android sensor or a connected Bluetooth LE/Ant+ device

You'll need

- a USB On-The-Go (OTG) capable device
- a USB-OTG adapter (USB-A/female to USB-micro/male for the cable which came with your Waterrower, or USB-mini/male to USB-micro/male)
- Waterrower with S4

Coxswain helps you organizing your rowing: Connect your Android device to your Waterrower, choose your training program and record your workout.

You'll need:
- a USB On-The-Go (OTG) capable device
- a USB-OTG adapter (USB-A/female to USB-micro/male for the cable which came with your Waterrower, or USB-mini/male to USB-micro/male for direct connection)

This app is under development. Please report problems and ideas.

Coxswain helps you organize your rowing: Connect your Android device to your Waterrower and choose your training program. 

- record your workout while watching Youtube videos or other media (choose an intent to be executed on training start)
- adjust the workout display to your needs (long press any value to change its binding)
- export your workout to TCX (Training Center XML) to import it into your favorite fitness tracking App or service.
- export your workout to Google Fit

You'll need
- a USB On-The-Go (OTG) capable device
- a USB-OTG adapter (USB-A/female to USB-micro/male for the cable which came with your Waterrower, or USB-mini/male to USB-micro/male for direct connection)
- Waterrower with S3 or S4 serial port: a serial to USB converter (experimental)
